Many of the verse texts within this manuscript appear only in a few manuscripts. There is also a pattern of the number seven. 
Many of the texts focused on the Seven deadly sins while some focused on the seven virtues and how to counteract them. 
Texts 11 to 15 all feature the number seven in some way. The texts that feature seven appear in both this manuscript and also 
London, British Library Harley 3954.There may be a connection between the two.

 PROJECT RESOURCES / MANUSCRIPT DESCRIPTION
Cambridge University Library, MS Ii.4.9
Described by: Ryan Perry from microfilm. 
Source: 
Revision Date: June 1st, 2010 

Heading
    Devotional miscellany, c. mid-3rd quarter C15.
Condition of the MS
    The MS is smudged and stained from use, but the condition is generally good.
Number of Items
    26
Title(s) of Pseudo-Bonaventuran Text(s)
    The compilator has taken two excerpts from the "Treatise on the Sacrament" in Nicholas Love's Mirror of the Blessed Life 
    (items 13-14), and has excerpted the chapter on the Last Supper from the 'Middle English Meditationes de Passione'. The 
    concluding couplet to the Northern Passion is also often found at the end of the Mirror.

Incipit
    It is interesting that many of the texts in the volume lack an incipit, and the titles of texts in the volume thus tends
    to be revealed through the explicit.
Colophon
    At the very end of the scribe A's stint (fol. 190r), he pens the colophon: "Nunc finem feci da michi quod merui" 
    (Now I have made an end, grant me what I deserve).
Explicit
    See entry for "Incipit".
Languages of the MS
    Texts are almost all in English, though almost always with Latin incipits and explicits.
Detailed Description of Contents
    1. Northern Passion, (IMEV 1907); the text concludes with a couplet normally found at the end of Love's Mirror, 
        IMEV 1728, fols 1r-42r.
    2. "The Long Charter of Christ", (IMEV 4154), fols 42v-47r.
    3. "Lamentacio sancte marie", English prose text written from the perspective of the Virgin Mary, and attributed 
        by the scribe to St. Ambrose; the text concludes "Quod Ambroos", "Explicit lamentacio sancte marie", fols 47r-51v.
        James records that the text was printed by Wynkyn De Worde (p. 448).
    4. 'The mawndy of our lorde', opening chapter of the "ME Meditationes de Passione", ends, "ye watyr of cedron & yere 
        A bode his traytour Iudas and other men armidde...Here endith the mawndy of our lorde"; fols 52r-55r.
    5. "The Lay Folk's Mass Book", IMEV 1323, 56r-60r.
    6. Prose commentary on, the Ten Commandments, the Deadly Sins, Christian virtues and works of mercy,
        followed by English translations of the Pater Noster, Ave Maria and Credo, fols 60v-63r.
    7. "IX poyntys of gret virtu", IMEV 1188, fols 63v-65v.
    8. "De tribulacione secundum vj doctores", Jolliffe, J 2[c], IPMEP 287, 65v-66v.
    9. "Erthe upon Erthe" [C Version] (IMEV 705), fol. 67r-68v; there is an illustration on fol. 68r, see "Ilustration" field .
    10. "Cur in hac miseria miseri moramini" (IMEV 4068), fol. 69r; this text 4-line is written in Latin 
        (in a hand that appears to be contemporary with but distinct from the two main scribes) and is 
        translated beneath by a possibly C16 reader; it seems possible that fol. 69r had originally been left blank 
        by the compiler of the book, possibly to maximise the effect of the striking illustration on fol. 68v.
    11. The Abbey of the Holy Ghost, English prose, fols 69v-87v.
    12. Robert of Sicily, IMEV 2780, fols 87v-94r.
    13. "Narracio de Sancto Edwardo", begins "We fynde wretyn", ends, "steryng to his loue. Amen"; excerpted from Love's 
        Mirror, Sargent 228:12-229:37; fols 94r-95r.
    14. 'Prayer to the Sacrament', excerpted from Love's Mirror, Sargent 238:10-239:4, fol. 95r-v; cf. BL Harley MS 4011.
    15. "Primus articulus pertinens ad deitatem", English prose articles of belief relating to the divinity of Christ, fols 95v-96r.
    16. "Hic incipiunt septem Arrticuli que pertinent ad humanitatem Ihesus", English prose articles of belief relating to
        Christ's humanity, fol. 96r.
        Note: fol. 96v is blank. 17. Titled "Decem Precepta" (in the explicit), excerpted from the treatment of the ten 
        commandments in Handlyng Synne (IMEV 778), fols 97r-142r; the text here omits 259 lines which appear in the fullest 
        versions of Handlyng Synne and 'adds five couplets, two odd lines, and a concluding prayer'. (Sullens p. xxv).
    18. "A treatise on Shrift and the Seven Deadly Sins" (IMEV 976), this text follows naturally from excerpt taken from
        Handlyng Synne, which promises to deal next with the Seven deadly sins- it is possible that the compiler chose not 
        to use Robert Mannyng's text for reasons of scribal economy, as the section here is less than half the length of the 
        corresponding portion in Handlyng Synne. 
    19. "The Five Bodily Wits, with a Form of Confession", IMEV 2314, fols 163v-165r.
    20. "Hec sunt virtutes septem", IMEV2059, fols 165r-173r.
21. "Ageyns temptacyouns and trybulacyouns". English prose text, fol. 169r.
22. 'The Seven acts of mercy', "Septem facta elemosine", IMEV 2061, fols 173r-177r.
23. "Hic incipiunt vij sacramenta ecclesie in Remissionemomnium peccatorum", IMEV 1901, fols 177r-185r.
24. Septem virtutes principales", IMEV 2045, fols 185r-188v.
25. "Hec sunt dona vij sancti spiritus", IMEV 215, fols 188v-190r.
26. Richard Rolle, A Form of Living, English prose; fols 190r-195r, 196r-197v [the final two leaves appear to have originally 
    been positioned at the front of the book, possibly acting as flyleaves].
Estimated Date of Production
    c. 3rd quarter C15.
Writing Support
    Paper.
Foliation
    197 fols.
Dimensions of Page and Writing Space
    Leaf size: 240 x 165 mm
    Writing Space: the writing space varies between prose and verse items, though there is generally a good deal of space 
    in the margins outside the ruled frames; Joan Baker asserts- "The rather generous bottom and outer margins suggest that, 
    although the MS was plain, legibility was not to be sacrificed for economy."
Collation
    Impossible to determine from microfilm; Guddat-Figge argued that the book contained eleven quires of 16 with a twelfth quire
    of 20 folios. (This leaves one leaf unaccounted for). It should also be pointed out that the final quire probably had one less
    bifolium at the point of manufacture, with a bifolium being later relocated from the front of the book. (See discussion in Hands).
Layout
    1 column throughout, 26-30 lines, frames ruled.
Illustration
    The opening initial in the book incorporates an unidentified coat of arms.
    There is well executed half page illustration following "Erthe upon Erthe", where a fashionably attired young gentleman 
    stands above ground, and a corpse within a bag lies below the earth.
Number of Scribal Hands
  2:
    Scribe A:	fols 1 - 95v l.14
    Scribe B	fols 95v l. 15 - 96r
    f. 96v blank
    Scribe A	fols 97r - 190r l.9
    Scribe B	fols 190r l.10 - f. 197v (excluding f. 195rv)
The positioning of scribe B's input into the book suggests he was filling space in an already compiled book. Baker
has argued that scribe B was perhaps an apprentice, who began his stint on fol. 95r because scribe A, "needed to be relieved". 
Such a view however, appears to have been developed against an understanding that items 14-16 are one text (as they have been 
presented in Guddat-Figge's description), and that scribe B was thus finishing a work which scribe A had been copying. Whilst I 
see an obvious relationship between items 15 and 16, the tone and subject matter of the 'Meditations on the Eucharist' does not 
seamlessly connect with the 2 subsequent items copied by scribe B. it is my opinion that scribe B has penned items 15 and 16 in 
the folio and half-page scribe A left at the end of this quire. Further evidence for this idea is furnished by scribe B's second
stint which begins on fol. 190r. Scribe A adds a note of finality to the end of his copy of item 25, following his explicit with,
"Nunc finem feci da michi quod merui" (Now I have made an end, grant me what I deserve). This, evidently was the end of the book
as far as scribe A was concerned. The remainder of fol. 190 and the 5 subsequent leaves of the quire were used by scribe B, and
when he ran out of space at the end of fol. 195r (the verso perhaps already rendered unusable by the scribblings of the book's 
owners/readers), it seems that he finished his stint on a bifolium once situated at the beginning of the MS that may have been 
functioning as flyleaves (they have since been moved to the rear of the book). This scenario is suggested by the scribe's 
direction at the bottom of fol. 195r "Turne to the begynnyng of þis book and þer schall 3e fynde the Ende of this matier". The book
had evidently already been bound when scribe B penned the item. Item 21 on fol 169r also appears to demonstrate a scribe responding
to a completed volume. Here the scribe (for contrary to Guddat-Figge's assertion that this is not scribe B but, "an almost 
contemporary hand" [102] it is certainly this scribe's script) pens the text "Ageyns temptacyouns and trybulacyouns", at a 
right-angle to scribe A's text, penning his lines in the spacious outer margin. Interestingly, this text apparently reveals 
scribe B as a reader of the book, as the prayer by "seynt Bryde" is designed to ward against (demonically inspired) temptation,
and occurs at a point in A's text where a lustful woman attempts to seduce St. Edmund. Here scribe B seemingly offers a salve to
the temptation suffered by Edmund within the text.
Style of Hands
    Both hands use Anglicana scripts that are heavily influenced by secretary forms.
Estimated Date of Hands
    A and B: c. 3rd quarter C15.
Scribal Annotation
    There are many scribal tags and sidenotes throughout the volume.
Notable Dialect Features
    Dialectally profiled in LALME, I:68, III:314-5, LP 621, grid 604 299.
Annotation and Marginalia
    Many maniculae and examples of (often indecipherable) annotation; Frances Foster has found some interesting examples of annotation 
    relating to the Northern Passion:
    "David planted whereon Crist hangd", fol 26v.
    "þe crosse olyf the tree cedyr", fol. 29r
    With a maniculum pointing to l. 1479: "þe naylis", fol. 30r.
Graffitti
    There are several examples of Latin and English pen trials along with the more significant biographic entries on fol. 195v.
Names recorded, signatures, ex libris marks
    There are a number of interesting inscriptions on fol. 195v: 
    "This is the boke off Sir Will Trew I[n] witnesse where for I thomas bareyle hauyng knowlage there off haue putt to myn signe";
    beneath this inscription several monograms of the same design are sketched, the first of which flanked by the letters 't' and 'b'. 
    Frances Foster argues that Thomas's hand corresponds with that of the hand which pens the explicit to the Northern Passion, and
    makes the claim that this is the main scribe- however, neither paleographic comparison nor the oblique terms in which Thomas 
    endorses William's ownership, convince me beyond doubt that Thomas penned the book. More convincing is Foster's argument that 
    the names Bareyle and Trew may be placed in Norwich, and rightly notes the possibility that the prefix 'ser' was appropriate not
    only to peers of the realm, but also to the parish priesthood.
    The book was certainly well read, indicated both by periodic annotation, later corrections to text (some of which indicate the 
    corrector either knowing, or having an exemplar of the damaged text [eg. correction to Handlyng Synne on fol. 125r]), and by the many
    maniculae that often link up to marked sections of text. The idea that this book was compiled for use by a Parson is certainly plausible.
    "John Cuttyng worsted in comitatu", C15-C16.
    "This is the boke ser Robt Hawe", C16. A.I. Doyle notes that a Robert Hawe was rector of Thetford c. 1473-81, and that "Thetford 
    was aan important centre of ecclesiastical life in the later Middle Ages in Norfolk...having two monasteries, a nunnery, two 
    friaries, a college, and six hospitals, as well as many churches and chapels", (Appendix, p. 56, N. 26)
    On fol. 87v: "Be me(?) Adam Ward", poss. C15.
Notes
    The manuscript can be linked on dialectal grounds and with reference to the names in the book to Norfolk. 
    A note from 1920 at the opening of the book states that a document, c. 1300, relating to Norwich and Segeford, was taken
    from beneath the bookplate. Joan Baker argues in respect of the names preserved in the manuscript that, "the volume appears
    to have been planned and executed under the supervision of or in close association with the secular clergy. The manuscript 
    was very likely intended for the private devotional reading of the pious family of such clergy". Certainly the compilator 
    of the manuscript (Thomas Bareyle or William Trew?) had an exceptional array of textual materials at his disposal, ranging 
    from widely disseminated texts such as Love's Mirror, and the The Abbey of the Holy Ghost to much more obscure works. It is
    possible that the compilator had access to a monastic or mendicant library.
