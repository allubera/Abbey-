This manuscript has several texts in common with the Abbey only manuscript, Cambridge UK, Cambridge University Library Dd.11.89.
This is interesting because some sources indicate Bodl Douce 141 is also an Abbey only manuscript. 
IF Abbey only manuscripts share similar collocation, this might be further proof.
