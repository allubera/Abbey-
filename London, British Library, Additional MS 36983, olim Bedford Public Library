It seems less devotional than some others.

Title(s) of Pseudo-Bonaventuran Text(s)

Meditations on the Supper of Our Lord and the Hours of the Passion
Incipit

The Meditations begins with a lengthy and probably innovated prose incipit, underlined in red ink:
Here begynneth þe meditacion of
þe pascion of crist & of þe
Lamentacion of ouyre Lady Saint
Mary þt Sche made for her
Son when Sche Se hym
torment among þe Iewis which
Was compiled of Bonaventure
A gode clerk & a cardinall of Rome
& þe meditaciones of all þe houris of þe day (fol. 118r)
Following the treatment of the Last Supper and Christ's capture is in the underlined heading, 'Now ffoloweth þe Meditacion Off Cristis Pascion' , fol. 120v.

For other incipits see Guddat-Figge and the British Library Description (hyperlink in Contents).

Colophon

Item 5 ends with a colophon which records the date of this text's completion, and perhaps, a general clue to the production period of other parts of the volume: 
"Thus endythe þe lyffe of þe iij
kyngys of coleyne primo die
Ianuare anno domini ml. cccc.xlijo" (fol. 215v)

Interestingly, the initials have been applied somewhat innovatively to the text on the final side of the text to form an acrostic spelling the name 'Thomas'. (See notes on the potential significance of this).

Detailed Description of Contents

Booklet I
1. Cursor Mundi (IMEV 2153); the text has received two major modications with items 2 and 3 replacing lines 14934-17082 and 22005-3908 respectively, fols 1-174v.
2. Meditations on the Supper (IMEV 248), compiler has (deliberately?) omitted the concluding couplet of the item as it appears in other versions; text interpolated within item 1, replacing the treatment of the Passion, fols 118rb-127rb.
3. Prick of Conscience, lines 4085-6407 (IMEV 3428; Manual, 7, p. 2486), fols 159rb-174v.
4. Geoffrey Chaucer, An ABC to the Virgin, IMEV 239), fols 175r-178v.
[John Thompson has argued that these opening items (quires 1-11), form a mini-anthology centred on the Cursor Mundi, might be viewed as the original book onto which other more miscellaneous materials were appended (p. 89) It might be argued that the Chaucerian item is a 'filler' item, making use of space at the end of the booklet; it may be no coincidence that further Chaucerian material is included in the filler items at the rear of booklet 3, and it is possible that these items, that is items 4 and 8-11 were copied into their respective booklets at the same time, and may feasibly have came from the same miscellaneous exemplar].

 

Booklet II
5. Prose English translation of John of Hildesheim's The Three Kings of Cologne, fols 179r-215v.

Booklet III
6. Titus and Vespasian (IMEV 1881; Manual, 1, p. 2547), fols 216r-255ra.
7. Part 3 of St. Michael's Legenda in the early English verse-legendary, edited by Horstmann (EETS., 1887); the text is here prefaced with a verse prologue attributing the work to Bede, fols 255ra-261vb; at the beginning of the text in very large letters is the invocation (sometimes found on funerary monuments) "Ihesu mercy lady help", and in equally large letters at the end of the text "ihc merci ladi help".
8. Geoffrey Chaucer, "Truth", lacks the Envoy, although 'Lenvoy' is written at the end of the item (and at the end of the subsequent two items- it appears that the compiler saw items 8-11 as a thematic unit, and the layout of these items in single columns tends to confirm such a view (IMEV 809), fol. 262r.
9. Balade (ascribed to Lydgate ?), eight stanzas with refrain, " None of all these I doo yow well assure | Off kyndely ryght may no while endure." Begins: " A knyght that is hardy as a lyon", (IMEV 55), fol. 262r-263r
10. "Learn or be Lewde", or "The ABC of Aristotle", (IMEV 471), fol. 263r-v
11. An 8-line poem in praise of Our Lady, begins: " Who couthe suche a womman counterffete | That on all ffolkys hathe compassion" (IMEV 4091), fols 262r-263r.
[Items 8-11 appear to be filler texts, utilising space at the end of this booklet; see discussion below item 4]


Booklet IV
12. Liber Ipotis (IMEV 220), the explicit, "Explicit Liber Ipotyse" is linked with a bracket to the incipit of item 13, suggesting the compiler perceived a thematic link between the texts, fols 264r-268r.
13. "Incipit Alquyne", Speculum Guy de Warwick (IMEV 1101), fols 268ra-275ra.
14. William Lychefeld, Complaint of God (IMEV 2714), fols 275rb-279va.
15. Verse life of St. Erasmus (IMEV 173), fols 279vb-280va; the item ends only halfway down the first column and the rest of the leaf has been left blank.
[Items 12-15 (quire 17) appear to be a thematically arranged unit within the volume].

Booklet V
16. The Abbey of the Holy Ghost (Manual, 7, p. 2545), fols 281r-285v.
17. The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost (Manual, 7, p. 2547), fols 285v-298v; the item ends halfway down the page and the remainder has been left blank.
[The Prose Abbey and Charter may also be considered as a unit within the volume].

Booklet VI
18. Mirror of Mankind (IMEV 1259), English verse dealing with the model of human life, fols 298r-305r.
19. Osbern Bokenham, "Life of St. Dorothy", ends imperfectly due to lost leaves (IMEV 3936); this text is found in Bokenham's Legends of Holy Women and his recently discovered Legenda Aurea; Simon Horobin understands the version here to vary from both; fol. 305v.

Estimated Date of Production

A production date for the entire volume between the late 1430s and mid-1440s seems likely.
Writing Support

Paper; the entire volume is described by Thompson as being "made up from one very large paper stock" (Thompson, p. 88).
Foliation

iii + 305 fols + i; the MS contains early foliation (poss. scribal) up until the end of the Cursor Mundi, (fol. 175 in original foliation, and 174 in modern, which fails to take the missing leaf between fols 8 and 9 into account).

Dimensions of Page and Writing Space

Leaf Size: 280 x 205 mm approx. (cropped)

Writing Space: The Cursor Mundi begins within a writing frame of 240 x 180 mm approx., but by the end of the first gathering, is already being written in an increasingly compressed frame; by the close of the transcription, the writing frame is approx. 205 x 170 mm.
The Three Kings is 215 x 155 mm approx.; booklet IV is generally 230 x 170 mm approx.

The prose items in booklet V begin, on the first folio of The Abbey in a frame of 225 x 145 mm approx., which by the verso side, and for the rest of the transcription becomes a 225 x 165 mm writing space.

Booklet VI uses a 225 x 120 mm frame.

The texts at the end of booklets 1 and 3 are penned without a consistent sense of a writing space, although the text is neatly justified, the text fills different lengths of the page from one folio to the next

.
Collation

118 -2? (fols 1-16; wants 1 and 9; no loss of text at beginning, but there is a textual lacunae between fols 8 and 9); 2-1016 (fols 17-160); 1118 (fols 161-78); 1218 (fols 179-96); 1320 -1? (fols 197-215, wants 20, no loss of text); 1414 (fols 216-29); 1518 (fols 230-47); 1616 (fols 248-63); 1718 -1? (fols 264-80, wants 1, no loss of text); 1814 -2? (fols 281-92, wants 3 and 14, with text missing on each occasion); 1916 -3? (fols 293-305, wants 14-16).

Layout

Varies between double and single column format with prose items, and items in long lines of verse in single columns; extreme variation in lines per page, from 25-41, and this within a single scribal stint; no ruling of lines or frames, except during the booklet copied by scribe C; no signs of pricking.

Rubrication/ Ordinatio

Initials: Highly idiosyncratic, amateurish initials throughout the parts of the book written by scribes A and B, often with elaborations including human heads, or with voids in the capital containing words (on several occasions 'Amor') and unusual infilling. The capitals in scribe C's booklet are no less amateurish (indeed, in the early parts of the transcription the scribe neglected to leave spaces for the capitals, and they have been penned in the margin), but are merely plain Lombard capitals; the last six capitals on fol. 215v form the name 'Thomas', perhaps the name of the scribe.
Titles, Headings, Rubrics: Where there are headings to items, they are usually penned in a thicker duct; throughout the book names, places, and important phrases and sections of text are underlined (in red)- sometimes this may be attributable to readers of the book rather than the producers; all prose sections in the MS include paraphs.
Other: Catchwords occur without further ornament.
Illustration

N/A
Number of Scribal Hands

A: fols 1r-2v, 216r-229v, 264r-305r.
B: fols 3r-178v, 230r-263v, 305v.
C: fols 179r-215v.
Style of Hands

3 hands, all fairly uncalligraphic and cursive. None of the hands are professional book-hands, but the confidence displayed by scribes A and B particularly, with their elaborate top-line/bottom-line ascenders/descenders, and otiose flourishes to words at the end of lines, strongly suggests these are professional scribes in some capacity, perhaps clerks or notaries.

Estimated Date of Hands

All hands would appear to date from the 2nd quarter C15. Scribe B dates his copy of item 5 to 1st January 1442.
Scribal Annotation

There is widespread use in the Cursor Mundi, but also at other points in the book, of marginal marks nota /paraph marks, apparently here marking significant passages.

Notable Dialect Features

LALME,vol. 1, p. 102, vol. 3, pp. 6-7. LP 8200. Grid 499 223 (Bedfordshire, in the vicinity of Dunstable); the sample is taken from the scribal stints of hands A and B in the Cursor Mundi. LALME also maps Ipotis by "Hand E" in Warwickshire, to a point roughly halfway between Redditch and Warwick (vol. 3, pp. 529-30. LP 4689. Grid 417 264) The editors recognise that the scribe copies in varying dialects: "This hand contributes several pieces, with language varying slightly from piece to piece" (III, p. 529). In fact, "scribe E" is almost certainly scribe A, whose small contribution to the Cursor Mundi was mapped to Bedfordshire. It seems likely that this scribe copied texts literatum, or at least was passive enough to include many of his exemplars' forms.

Annotation and Marginalia

Despite the obvious signs of regular usage there are surprisingly few annotations in the book. The more interesting examples are listed below:

Fol. 23v2: 'Nota de peccato luxurie', penned above column in upper margin and in the intercolumnar space, C15.
Fol. 75r2: an unusual mark with four circles on a stem marking mention of Mary in the listing of the bloodline of Christ, C15.
Fol. 137v1: "[R]esurexcon sone [a]ffter þe [-]issencon", C15.
Fol. 159v1: "The Beginning of Ante christ", C16?
Fol. 160v1: Axe-shaped nota mark (red?), beside discussion of the false miracles of the antichrist.
Fol. 189v: In margin beside text explaining the reason for the colour of the Red Sea (this text underlined), "lete here the cause why ye water of the rede sea semeth rede, although it be of ye coller of other waters", C16.
Fol. 199v: Adjacent to account of milk from Mary's breast which fell onto a rock still being visible, and relics of the milk becoming objects of veneration: "A fayned miracle of oure Ladys mylke", C16?
