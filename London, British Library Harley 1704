The Prioress' tale from the Canterbury Tales is included in this manuscript. Although the tale apprears in several other 
manuscripts, it is an outlier in this group of manuscirpts. No other manuscript contained both the Prioress' Tale and 
The Abbey or The Charter (or any conflated version). Chaucer is not a usual companion for the Abbey and the Charter.
