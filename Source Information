Discrepancies : Other sources have stated that Corpus Christi College and Vespasian are the same text. This list also insinuates Douce 323 is a Charter only manuscript. It also insinuates that Douce 141 is an Abbey only manuscript. 
Due to this new information, Jesus College MS 46 has been moved to the conflated text section. 

This list contained folio information for all texts except the Hopton Hall manuscript.

"A manual of the writings in Middle English" volume 7
The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184]
A translation of the prose 'abbaye du saint esprit'. 
Extant in 24 manuscripts and three early prints. 
The Charter of the Abbey [186] is appended in 16 manuscripts and conflated to it in three others,
Bodl Library MS Douce 323, Bradfer Lawrence and Hopton Hall, 
other sources indicate that Hopton Hall and Bradfer Lawrence are the same manuscript that is now in the KEIO Library). 
The Englsih Abbey is closely related to a late redaction of the French text found in British Library MS Royal 16.E.xii 
dating from the mid-fourteenth century. It contains much rhetorical amplification and interpolative matter of a mystical 
nature not in the original. Consacro interprets it as a treatise on the Mixed Life addressed to devout men and women who 
cannot enter a religious community. It urges them to a spritual life, with particular emphasis on contemplation, 
conceived as the exercise of charity and other virtues under the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. Its composition may
be assigned to the thrid quarter of the fourteenth century. The dialect of the earliest and best mansuscript - The Vernon- 
is southwestern. Allen suggests that its author was a follower of Rolle.

The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost 
A prose treatise symbolically linking the fortunes of The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184] with appropriate incidents 
in the Biblical narrative from the fall to the redemption. It is preserved in 24 mansuscripts and three early prints. 
Although altogether independent of The Abbey, it follows it in sixeen manuscripts and is conflated with it in three others 
(as listed above). Its appearance in the Vernon manuscript indicates that it was composed before 1380 probably 
in the Southwest of England. the charter is not modelled on the Abbey. despite their close relationship in the manuscript
tradition. Although the figure of the spiritual abbey is taken from the earlier treatise, it is made to serve, as 
Dr. Brooks notes, merely as a vehicle for an allegorical meditation on the spiritual implications of the scriptural events. 
Within the general allegory has been incorporated a version of the Four Daughters of God and a Carta Dei which bears 
a faint resemblance to the Charter of Christ [187]. Some of the biblical material has been taken from a Middle English 
devotional work " The life of the Virgin Mary and Christ" extant in Trinity college Dublin MS 423. This section goes on
to include other texts that contain the motif of the Four Daughters. These examples are supposed to be nearly identical
versions of the Four Daughters.

Information on the confusion between Corpus Christi Oxford 155 and Cotton Vespasian D.ix 
Although they are listed as two separate manuscripts in the "Manual of the Writings of Middle English" 
and  "A checklist of Middle English Prose Writings of Spritual Guidance", later works (such as the current
description of the contents on the University of Oxford website) have the two manuscripts listed as on manuscript 
that has been broken into two at some point in the past.

Lay Piety and Religious Discipline in Middle English Literature 
Chapter I 
"If linguistisc translation respnds to what Roger Ellis calls 'a perceived intellectual/cultural lack, which the translator hopes the translation will make good' then these spiritual rules respond to a perceived lack of appropriate guidance material for pious laity. In this chatper I consider two guides, 'The Abbey' and 'Fervor Amoris', which encourage their lay readers to imagine themselves part of an order of spiritually committed laypeople, while recongnizing that the transformation of laypeople's internal, spiritual status could have implications for the transformation of external social and religious roles. The Abbey and Fervor Amoris, both couring an interest in "para-monastic forms of spirituality",, translate monastic models of regulation, stability, and enclosure for their anticipated lay readers, while carefully discouraging the detachment from the wrold that actual cloistered life (at least in its ideal form) would entail. The authorso f these works posit lay spiritual enthusiasm as a potentially disruptive force, elusive to clerical authority because it may be intertwined with readers' material ambitions and involve unchecked desire for contemplative experience, social transformation or both. thus texts must mediate between desire and discipline." PAGES 17-20
PAGE 21 The Abbey of the Holy Ghost and the discipline of the cloister 
As this study's only translation from one langugage to another, and likely its earliest lay spiritual rule, 'The Abbey' requires attention to its function in an English social context. The Abbey is a short allegorical meditation originally written for aristocratic laywomen in French, later translated and transformed to attract a spiritually inclined English readership. The sotry of this work's development is one of adaptation for a growing audience in need of rules for the spiritual life: an imagine "lay readership striving to realise and fulfill its spiritual potential." In and through this changing text, the English adaptor expresses optimism and growing concern about lay spiritual life, changing the work to appeal to a wider, more diverse audience, while circumscribing the universe of pratices and identifications that it offers to readers, increasingly imposing a "sense of limits" on lay spiritual autonomy.
this work began its life as a meditation in French (L'abbaye du Saint Esprit c. 1300) and was transated into English, probabaly in the last quarter of the 14the century, as the Abbey of the Holy Ghost. This new work offers English readers a guide more explanaotry, more concrete and more detailed than its French precursor, designed to reach a wier audience while at the same time leaving less room for the "regulated improvisations" that the French text encouraged. A pronounced reliance on female monastic models enables the Abbey adaptor to translate the tradition of 'stabilitas' and the mandate of enclosure still in place for nuns and anchoresses, into virtues simultaneously spiritual and social for both men and women. ... In the case of the Abbey the new allegorical boundaries of the cloister encourag monastic personification while shoring up priestly control over the terms of religous discipline. ... Although it is common for monastic authors to describe the heart as an inner, textual space to be inscribed with the "writing" of thought the Middle English Abbey inscribes a new "religion of herte" that revises its French original in subtle but significant ways. The Abbey carefully targets a wide range of lay readers those who enthusiastically sought spritual capital through affiliation with religious houses with a guide that offers them a chance to engage in independent self-discipline and meditation without causing social disruption or evading clerical meditation.

Return to female Enclosure: Building the Abbey In London, British Library MS Harley 5272
"Many of the guides considered in this study seem, perhaps counterintuitively to have reached as many or more readers in religious life as they did readers in the world. However it attained some degree of lay readership, the Abbey, likely the earliest of the guides and the one surviving in the largest number of copies, very often returned to the cloister. The earliest extant copy survives in the compendious Vernon MS, along with Hilton's mixd life and the A-text of Piers Plowman. And During the 15th century, when religious houses maintained their centrality as ccenters of copying and focal points for lay devoition and the exchange of books with laypeople, circulation of the Abbey demonstrates what what A. I Doyle calls "that close dependence on religious communiites in which all vernacular devotional works, even those addressed more inclusively tended to remain." 
One can readily see that why the Abbey might be a welcome addition to an orthodox fifteenth centry devotional collection. the monastic conceit that organizes the text and its emphasis on the need for clerical meditation to etablish the "religious of herte" place this composite work above theological reproach, certainly beyond suspician of Lollardy at a moment marked, as Sargent has argued, ,by a "closing of ranks around precisely those kinds of literature to which the Wycliffites most objected." 
Although the Abbey was explicitly adapted for male and female readers in the world, its circulation was especially strong among vowed religious, male and female, and among women readers in and out of religous life. MS Harley 5272 is a neatly copied,carefully decorated mid 15th centruy parchment book, written by a single scribe who identifies himself as 'Iohannes fforster' on fol 98v. John Lydgate's 'Life of our Lady" is the longest work in the codex, occupying 98 of the book's 137 total leaves. The volume then features a verse life of the 14th century virigin martyr st. Dorothy and concludes with the Abbey followed by the Charter. Places after these female saints lives the Abbey reinforces in a theoretical mode, in prose rather than verse, the emphasis of the vitae in conemplation, virginity and enclosure. "

Reform Continues: Imitation Cerici in oxford, Bodleian Library MS Laud Misc 210 
"Examination of MS Harley 5272, Lincoln Cath MS 91, and MS Ashmole 751 reveals the appeal and accessiility of 14th century spritul guidance to elite laity and those in professional religous lie, whether nuns or priests. But the uses of Abbey and Mixed Life were varied even among these readers. ...
The contents of this book, Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc 210, a mid 15th century codex of unknown origins and ownership, show that even in what has been characcterizzed as an tmosphere of anxiety about heresy and a dangerous time for the composition of new vernacular theology. challenging combinations of texts were still being made in manuscrpts. whoever the compilere and whatever the rationale for this collection, which includes catechetical works, the guides "Book to a mother" and " THe life of Soul" and  a wycliffite tract, these contents combine to suggest a polemical vision of shared lay and clerical knowlege and practice. 
The categories of orthodox and heterdox reading are notoriously slippery ones throughout the 15the century. Material from the English Wycliffite Bible frequently reached readers with little interest in heterodoxy; on the other hand, orthodox devotional texts were eagerly used by Lollards in the later part of the 15th and early 16th centuries. Ms Laud Misc 210 a manuscript that combines aspects of tradtional relgious thought with quite controversial statements, might well have appealed to a range of readers, lay or religious, interested in interrogating the question of how religious life should be lived. Although the manuscript lacks any ownership marks or evidence of insitiutional provenance, the codex can be considered an anthology by virtue of its careful organization. The Collection was copied by one scribe with the exception of the last text, The Abbey, which was added at a later date. This compile was evidently more concerned with what Dutton calls "the Decalogue, the theology of lvoe, and the necessity of resisting evil" than with the orthodoxy of every single text: he book thus falls into Hudson's category of "manuscripts that appear to be orthodox in initiative but contain isolted Wycliffite texts." This manuscript persistently emphasizes religious fundamentals and the importance of the active life in the world, although the presence of eremetic and monastically influenced works (Rolles Form of Living and the Abbey, the first and final texts in the codex) suggest that this compiler, like Thornton, considered multiple modes of reading and guidance to be complimentary. The inclusion of these texts, which encourage modes of life and practice criticized by the Lollards, offers another caution against assuming this volume to be a Wycliffite manuscript.A
After the Form of Living, the rest of the books early contents repeat and reinforce items basic to the Syllabus and emphasize the need for active imitation of Christ in the world. Book to a mother appears immediately after the form of living booklet, followed by several shorter texts that emphasize particular elements of the catechism, crucial aspects of the active life, and the benefits of tribulation in the world. ...
The short text immediately after Book to a Mother begins " Diliges dominum deum tuum ex toto corde." Yow schalt loue ... (neighbor as thyself and such)... 
This text is followed by three works, evidently copied to go together, including an acephalous Visitacio infirmorum, De Utilitatibus Tribulationis, and the Life of Soul. 

Lincoln Cath MS 91 PAGE 140 A Gengtryman's Mixed Life in Lincoln Cathedral MS 91 and Priestly censorship in oxford, Bodleian Library MS Ashmole 751
"... the latter is a Yorkshire gentryman Robert Thornton's well-known 'devotional book' covering fols 179-279 of this large volume. Thornton's book, varied in its contents suggests that this 15th century layman, whose devotional leanings and worldly resonsibilities may have resembled those of Hilton's lay addressee, use the book to structure his own moderate version of the mixed life of action and contemplation. Thorntons copy of the Mixed Life, sandwiched between the devotional lyric "Thi Ioy be ilke a dele to serue hi godd to paye" and the prose treatise An epistle of Salvation, lacks the first 218 lines, beginnging abruptly but characteristically with a comparison of the layman to the prelate ..." "... Thornton collected treatises on the Pater Noster, the Ten commandments, the seven gifts of the holy ghost and John Gaytryge's sermon, the Middle English expansion of Archbishop Thoresbys Catechism. Thornton also copied texts covering a wide range of contempative activity: The Abbey of the Holy Ghost along with texts focused on the passion such as The Previtie on that passio and texts promoting somewhat more speculative approaches, including the Mirror of St Edmundl originally written for enclosed religious."

Middle English Religious Prose 
N.F. Blake 
Section V - The Abbey of the Holy Ghost  PAGE 88
"This piece is extant in many manuscripts, of which the most important are: Bodley MS. Laud 210 (c.1370) [L]; The Vernon MS (Cf.VI) [B]; the Thornton MS (Cf.IV)[T]; Columbia University Library MS Plimpton 263(c.1440); and Lambeth Palace LibraryMS 32 (15th century). A modified version was printed by de Worde c.1496. Although in the Lambeth MS it is attributed to Rolle, it is now accepted that this text is at best a translation from French by one of his followers. Indeed the translation was probably made in the South rather than the North, for it appears in a northern dialect only in T. Its date of composition can be placed between 1350 and 1370. In some MS it is found with a piece called The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost, though it is almost certainly a work of a different author; the two pieces are amalgamated in some MS and in de Worde's print. THe French text from which the Abbey is derived exists in at least three versions: (i) British Museum Ms. Add 39843 [A] and other MSS; (ii) British Museum MS Royal 16 E xii [R] and other MSS; and (iii) MS Douce 365 [D] copied by David Aubert 1475 probably for Margaret of Burgundy. The English text is closest to R, though it also has some points of similarity to D. 
The Traditional psychomachia in which vices and virtues were personified and engaged in combat found its expression in England in the thirteenth century in such words as Sawles Warde and Robert Grosseeste's Chateau d'Amour. At least four translations and adaptations into English of Grosseteste's work were executed. The Abbey continues this tradition forward into the fourteenth century. However as a manual of piety for those who were unable to enter a monastery or a nunnery, it may be compared with the English translation of the Speculum Vitae and Walter Hilton's Epistle on the Mixed Life. The moral exhortation is only of the nost general kind and does not amount to a practical guide to the conduct of life. This text is based on L."
