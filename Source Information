Discrepancies : Other sources have stated that Corpus Christi College and Vespasian are the same text. This list also insinuates Douce 323 is a Charter only manuscript. It also insinuates that Douce 141 is an Abbey only manuscript. 
Due to this new information, Jesus College MS 46 has been moved to the conflated text section. 

This list contained folio information for all texts except the Hopton Hall manuscript.

The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184]
A translation of the prose 'abbaye du saint esprit'. 
Extant in 24 manuscripts and three early prints. 
The Charter of the Abbey [186] is appended in 16 manuscripts and conflated to it in three others,
Bodl Library MS Douce 323, Bradfer Lawrence and Hopton Hall, 
other sources indicate that Hopton Hall and Bradfer Lawrence are the same manuscript that is now in the KEIO Library). 
The Englsih Abbey is closely related to a late redaction of the French text found in British Library MS Royal 16.E.xii 
dating from the mid-fourteenth century. It contains much rhetorical amplification and interpolative matter of a mystical 
nature not in the original. Consacro interprets it as a treatise on the Mixed Life addressed to devout men and women who 
cannot enter a religious community. It urges them to a spritual life, with particular emphasis on contemplation, 
conceived as the exercise of charity and other virtues under the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. Its composition may
be assigned to the thrid quarter of the fourteenth century. The dialect of the earliest and best mansuscript - The Vernon- 
is southwestern. Allen suggests that its author was a follower of Rolle.

The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost 
A prose treatise symbolically linking the fortunes of The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184] with appropriate incidents 
in the Biblical narrative from the fall to the redemption. It is preserved in 24 mansuscripts and three early prints. 
Although altogether independent of The Abbey, it follows it in sixeen manuscripts and is conflated with it in three others 
(as listed above). Its appearance in the Vernon manuscript indicates that it was composed before 1380 probably 
in the Southwest of England. the charter is not modelled on the Abbey. despite their close relationship in the manuscript
tradition. Although the figure of the spiritual abbey is taken from the earlier treatise, it is made to serve, as 
Dr. Brooks notes, merely as a vehicle for an allegorical meditation on the spiritual implications of the scriptural events. 
Within the general allegory has been incorporated a version of the Four Daughters of God and a Carta Dei which bears 
a faint resemblance to the Charter of Christ [187]. Some of the biblical material has been taken from a Middle English 
devotional work " The life of the Virgin Mary and Christ" extant in Trinity college Dublin MS 423. This section goes on
to include other texts that contain the motif of the Four Daughters. These examples are supposed to be nearly identical
versions of the Four Daughters.
