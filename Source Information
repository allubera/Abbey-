Discrepancies : Other sources have stated that Corpus Christi College and Vespasian are the same text. This list also insinuates Douce 323 is a Charter only manuscript. It also insinuates that Douce 141 is an Abbey only manuscript. 
Due to this new information, Jesus College MS 46 has been moved to the conflated text section. 

This list contained folio information for all texts except the Hopton Hall manuscript. 

"A manual of the writings in Middle English" volume 7
The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184]
A translation of the prose 'abbaye du saint esprit'. 
Extant in 24 manuscripts and three early prints. 
The Charter of the Abbey [186] is appended in 16 manuscripts and conflated to it in three others,
Bodl Library MS Douce 323, Bradfer Lawrence and Hopton Hall, 
other sources indicate that Hopton Hall and Bradfer Lawrence are the same manuscript that is now in the KEIO Library). 
The Englsih Abbey is closely related to a late redaction of the French text found in British Library MS Royal 16.E.xii 
dating from the mid-fourteenth century. It contains much rhetorical amplification and interpolative matter of a mystical 
nature not in the original. Consacro interprets it as a treatise on the Mixed Life addressed to devout men and women who 
cannot enter a religious community. It urges them to a spritual life, with particular emphasis on contemplation, 
conceived as the exercise of charity and other virtues under the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. Its composition may
be assigned to the thrid quarter of the fourteenth century. The dialect of the earliest and best mansuscript - The Vernon- 
is southwestern. Allen suggests that its author was a follower of Rolle. 

Eight Ghostly Dwelling Places[185] 
A brief prose passage analagous to The Abbey of the Holy Ghost 
No other information indicating what kind of connection exists 

The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost 
A prose treatise symbolically linking the fortunes of The Abbey of the Holy Ghost [184] with appropriate incidents 
in the Biblical narrative from the fall to the redemption. It is preserved in 24 mansuscripts and three early prints. 
Although altogether independent of The Abbey, it follows it in sixeen manuscripts and is conflated with it in three others 
(as listed above). Its appearance in the Vernon manuscript indicates that it was composed before 1380 probably 
in the Southwest of England. the charter is not modelled on the Abbey. despite their close relationship in the manuscript
tradition. Although the figure of the spiritual abbey is taken from the earlier treatise, it is made to serve, as 
Dr. Brooks notes, merely as a vehicle for an allegorical meditation on the spiritual implications of the scriptural events. 
Within the general allegory has been incorporated a version of the Four Daughters of God and a Carta Dei which bears 
a faint resemblance to the Charter of Christ [187]. Some of the biblical material has been taken from a Middle English 
devotional work " The life of the Virgin Mary and Christ" extant in Trinity college Dublin MS 423. This section goes on
to include other texts that contain the motif of the Four Daughters. These examples are supposed to be nearly identical
versions of the Four Daughters.

Information on the confusion between Corpus Christi Oxford 155 and Cotton Vespasian D.ix 
Although they are listed as two separate manuscripts in the "Manual of the Writings of Middle English" 
and  "A checklist of Middle English Prose Writings of Spritual Guidance", later works (such as the current
description of the contents on the University of Oxford website) have the two manuscripts listed as on manuscript 
that has been broken into two at some point in the past.

3 The manuscripts are listed in the theses of Consacro and Fanning, and (under H. 9 and H. 16) in
P. S. Jolliffe, A Check-List of Middle English Prose Writings of Spiritual Guidance (Toronto: Pontifical Institute
of Medieval Studies, I974); (as numbers 39 and 590) in R. E. Lewis, N. F. Blake, and A. S. G. Edwards,
Index of Printed Middle English Prose (New York: Garland, 1985); and (as entries I84 and i86) in R. R.
Raymo, 'Works of Religious and Philosophical Instruction', in A Manual of the Writings in Middle English
Io50- 500, vii, ed. by A. E. Hartung (Hamden, CT: Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences,
1986). To Jolliffe's lists, which are the fullest, the following corrections can be made: Bodleian MS
Douce 323 contains an amalgamation of both Abbey (fols I53v-I58v) and Charter (fols 140V--53v,
I58- I 59V); the Hopton Hall MS was sold by Sotheby's on 8 December 1989, lot 89, and is now in the
library of Keio University, Tokyo; 'Sotheby's 13 / io / 42 lot 172', in fact sold by Sotheby's on
14 October 1942 to become Bradfer-Lawrence 8, was sold again at Sotheby's on 5 December i989, lot
89, and is now in private hands in Tokyo (this manscript contains a conflated and abbreviated form of
the Abbey and Charter, similar to that in de Worde's printed editions); BL MS Cotton Vespasian D. xiii,
fol. 18 I, was originally part of the manuscript which is now Oxford, Corpus Christi College MS E 155.
The texts survive together in eighteen manuscripts, with the Abbey alone in a further five manuscripts, 
and the Charter alone in a further six (see n. o for details of these). The printed editions (all of which
contain both, in abbreviated form) are listed in A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland,
and Ireland, I475-I640, first compiled by A. W. Pollard and G. R. Redgrave, 2nd edn begun by W. A.
Jackson and F. S. Ferguson, completed by K. F. Pantzer, 3 vols (London: Bibliographical Society,
986-9 ), numbers 13608.7- I 36 . On these see also C. F. Biihler, 'The First Edition of the Abbey of the
Holy Ghost', Studies in Bibliography, 6 (1954), I -o6.
