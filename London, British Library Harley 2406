    (b. 1689, d. 1741), 2nd earl of Oxford and Mortimer, book collector and patron of the arts. 
    Edward Harley bequeathed the library to his widow, Henrietta Cavendish, née Holles (b. 1694, d. 1755) during her lifetime and 
    thereafter to their daughter, Margaret Cavendish Bentinck (b. 1715, d. 1785), duchess of Portland; the manuscripts were sold by
    the Countess and the Duchess in 1753 to the nation for £10,000 (a fraction of their contemporary value) under the Act of Parliament
    that also established the British Museum; the Harley manuscripts form one of the foundation collections of the British Library.
