I. Doyle thought that this copy may have been copied from (the only other extant version of the text) in Harley 2398, owing to a peculiarity of script that may have been an attempt to imitate the forms of the Harley scribe; there are, several other texts in the MS that are also found in Harley 2398; fols 125vï¿½126r.

Estimated Date of Production

The earliest portion of the book (fols 40-140) may have been penned towards the end of the C14; items 1 and 2 were probably penned in the early C15; fol. 39 and items 51-52 are mid-C15 (or later) additions.
Writing Support

Fols i-ii, 1-38 and 146 (the end flyleaf) are parchment; fols 39-145 are paper, although parchment strips with Latin writing (early C15?) have been used to strengthen the spines of quires. 
Watermarks: "The watermarks are difficult to discern, but include what may be either a 'couronne' or a 'feuille', and an 'ancre', neither obviously identifiable in Briquet; also a 'balance', resembling Briquet 2365 (1369-72)" (Catalogue 60).

Dimensions of Page and Writing Space

 

Leaf Size: 245 x 155 mm approx.
Writing Space: Varies, but a sense of economy is evident throughout the book, with most of the page used for text and little marginal space; scribe A, 205-10 x 135 (approx); scribe C, 195-205 x 135-145 (approx.)
 

Collation

1-212, 314, (a single leaf, fol. 39, is inserted between quires 3 and 4); 410 -1 (wants 5, after fol. 43), 518, 610, 7-912, 1012 -4 (wants 6, 8-10), 1112, 1216 -1 (wants 16).

Quire signatures begin at A on fol. 40 (and signatures continue, where visible, to the final quire 'I') ; 'A' may have once been the second gathering of an original book constructed by scribe C, with scribe A's gatherings perhaps added in the early C15.
Layout

1 column, scribe A: 45-47 lines; scribe C: 33-49 lines; only frames ruled throughout.

Rubrication/ Ordinatio

Initials: Plain red capitals 2-8 line throughout the book.
Titles, Headings, Rubrics: Scribe A's stint incorporates red headings, and with letters touched in red; in Scribe B's stint headiings are marked by red paraphs, which are also used to provide subdivisions throughout his prose items. Important phrases, names and Latin tend to be underlined in C's items.
Other: Both A and C's stints similarly include side notes with rough boxes around them.

Number of Scribal Hands

5:
A: fols 1-38v.
B: fol 39r-v
C: fols 40-143r.
D: fols 143v-145.
E: items on ii verso and 146r.
Style of Hands

A: neat and regular but uncalligraphic anglicana bookhand, with some secretary influence (tapered minums and descenders; usually a rounded, falling back form of 'e'; no feet on minums; anglicana 'w', with two curling ascenders of equal size; figure-of-eight 'g', 'a' with two chambers, sometimes formed with a horizontal stroke dividing one rounded lobe, but more often in typical anglicana fashion; the scribe uses 'th' rather than thorn. Scribe A uses a variety of punctus marks, with a dot used for minor pauses, and the punctus elevatus or virgule indicating a greater pause. Sections end with a double virgule mark. Scribe A also tends to provide idiosyncratic flourishes to top-line ascenders.
C: Scribe C's stint is marked by a variety of uncalligraphic, functional anglicana scripts, but perhaps with enough consistencies to indicate the work of a single hand- the most distinctive feature is the scribe's thorn, with a short descender that leans very markedly to the right; this scribe also betrays some Secretary influence, particularly in the sharp pointed descenders; the script is more cursive than 'A'; uses a very similar repertoire of punctus marks in comparison to A, with dots, punctus elevatus, virgule and double virgule being similarly used in prose items. It is possible that the changes in script are in part to do with the scribe's choice of pen; the thick ducted dark script that fills fols 60v–76v and 125v–143r, and that also provides an Incipit/Explicit to item 31 has a particularly stiff and distinctive aspect, contrasting with the looser scripts found elsewhere in the book. Click link for an image of fol. 139v courtesy of the Repertorium of Middle English Prose Sermons (University of Hull). If C's stint is in the fact the work of 2 or 3 scribes, the heterogeneity of forms (see particularly the common use of an idiosyncratic 'w' form), it would suggest a team of scribes who had learned remarkably similar habits in the same house or institution, and who were co-operating closely on the production.

Scribal Annotation

Many of the items in scribe C's section particularly have side notes, usually set in a box or rectangle shape (interestingly, the sidenotes to the Chastising are also boxed (perhaps indicating a house style); a detailed study of the issues picked up on in the marginal notes should prove interesting.
Fol. 73r: the word 'þenkyng' in the text (item 9), attracts the Latin gloss 'cogitacio' (Knight, , 125: 1055).
Notable Dialect Features

Scribe C's dialect is described in the Pepys' Library Catalogue description as being of the West Midlands, and the fact that one of the parchment strips refers to 'Payneswyk in Com. Gloucestre' is used as further evidence for such a provenance. One probable source MS for the Pepys MS scribe, BL Harley 2398, is located in LALME to Gloucestershire (I: 112, LP 7200). I have taken a sample of forms from item 2 in A's stint, and from items 4-5, and 9-11 in scribe C's stint. C's forms are prefaced by *.

Sample of Forms

give- 3yue, *3yue

call- clepe, *clepe

our- owre(e), *owr(e), oure

work- werk, wurche, worke, *werke

world- wordle, *wordle.


Both scribes A and B appear to produce texts that are of a fairly consistent dialect, and with a Gloucestershire provenance likely in each case. Some of the more telling forms include 'whuche' (A and C), 'burye' (A), and the unusual 'wordle' [world] (A and C), a form that is especially characteristic of the Gloucestershire region.

Notes

The Pepys Catalogue description suggests that the book might have been penned by, or compiled for "a male recluse" (xxv). The opening address in the Chastising speaks to a friend, rather than a sister. The book has a number of items that might be of interest to a recluse, such as those by Rolle, with one Rolle text headed, 'For men and wymmen that beþ enclosed', fol. 108r. There is an intriguing alteration to the item here entitled "Meditacione bona"- where Pepys 2125 deviates from standard versions of the text; at the bottom of fol. 117v we are told, "I thanke þe hertily . my lord...for þe hast nat clepid me to þe rewle of seynt Benet . ne of saynt Austyn . ne of seynt ffraunceys. ne to non oþer rewle ordeynyd by mannes chesyng . but to þt souereyn & to þt hyest rewle . þe..."; the next leaf has been removed, suggesting for Rosamond McKitterick and Richard Beadle, that the adaptor of the text (perhaps the copyist), may have expressed "an unorthodox sentiment of some kind, possibly Lollard" (xxv).
The mixture of texts in the MS is not entirely suggestive of a Lollard reader, although some of the texts in the book, such as the Three Arrows of Doomsday and the Sermon by Thomas Wimbledon are known to have circulated in Lollard contexts (see the description of Cambridge, Trinity College MS MS B.14.38). The volume is notable for the large proportion of very rare or currently unique texts, including the otherwise unknown trans. of pseudo-Bonaventure (item 2). As such, the items in the book do appear to indicate some level of institutional or individual isolation. In some respects, the book would not seem out of place in a lay religious community such as a Benguinage, or perhaps even within a secular household in which ambitious religious reading and meditation was encouraged. Certainly, the book has a marked focus on Christological piety, and incorporates a number of texts on the Life and Passion, prayers to Christ, to the Arma Christi, and to the Holy name of Christ.
