A Descriptive Catalogue of the manuscripts in the library of Jesus College Cambridge 
by Montague Rhodes James 
Lists the contents of the manuscript in their entirety. 
However, the list is in what appears to be Latin. Due to this, it will be nearly impossible to compare 
the texts against the texts in other manuscripts. To avoid duplication, this manuscript will not be 
analyzed for its contents until an English source is located.
