A: fols 1-19v (quires 1-2, item 1).

C: fols 99-121v (quires 11-13, item 5).
Style of Hands

All hands are described by Ker as mid-C15 mixed Anglicana/secretary scripts- all scribes use a 'y' version of thorn, although C adopts a regular thorn on fols 99-102v; A and B use a double compartment 'a', whilst B adopts a single lobed version. The hands are not calligraphic book-hands, but represent informal varieties of script.
