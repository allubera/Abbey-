The South English Legendary texts make up a large part of this manuscipt. Since these texts circulate together 
and the DIMEV lists these specific group of texts as circulating together in several manuscripts, I will be combining them 
under the heading South English Legendaries and treating them as a body of work rather than individual texts. 
This specific group of South English Legendary texts can also be found in the Vernon manuscript as well as the Winchester 33.

The last flyleaf carries the naem (c.1600?) Thomas Smythe. 
1634 catalogue : added in a later hand. c.1660
It is evident that at some time probably late in the XVth century or early in the XVI century this collection did not include what is now the central portion (beginning the with item "Here it speketh of the fruyt calle dChristendom._ 
this can ben seen by the chalk numeration of the sections, which run on from (4) on the page where the Vita Sancti Petri Apostoli begins to (5) on the first page of the gospel of Nicodemus. On the other hand the collection was in its present form when the index, in a XVIIthe century hadn was made (1660)
the flyleaves now bound in at the end are art of a tract by Erasmus, "Erasmus Roterdamus de ratione conscribendi epistolas" 
This MS must be very nearly contemporary. 
The last flyleaf has two medical recipes (XVIth) 
          ' A good medicine for raynes'
          ' Take the flower of brome' etc 
This hand reminds me strongly of a hand in the Liber Albus f.182, documents of 1539 and 1540. and I think that the book may have been in the college community at that time
paper. At present bound in 2 vols, labelled 33A and 33B, bound by Miss B.M. Forder. Size of leaves 8 (4-5)/16 x 5 (8-11)/16
First flyleaf, with index about 1660, a separate leaf. 
33A : sections 1-5 twelves (section 4 one leaf presumably blank cancelled) Section 6, 14 leaves 
33B : First section of 8 leaves, second 12: three and four eights with one blank not cancelled; the Erasmus at the end of the leaves, one a blank uncancelled but pasted. There are 3 XVIIth century blank flyleafs at the end of 33 B
