Some of the texts in this manuscript concern Arthur and romances (such as the Morte Arthur). A few deal with charms and another 
section concerns religoius and devotional texts. Some of the texts that were devotional in nature were widely shared between the manuscripts 
while the other texts circulated in manuscripts that did not contain the Abbey (whether they contained other devotional texts is 
unknown). The focus of prayer in this manuscript was to Jesus (rather than to Mary or the trinity).

**All Miracle of the Virgin texts will be treated as a single entry due to their similar nature**

Titles, Headings, Rubrics: There is one use of a marginal paraph/nota mark, of the type that sometimes indicates major subdivisions within a chapter in a prose text, or of the kind that might indicate stanza divisions within verse texts (this marks the final scribal annotation); Thornton also uses Virgula suspensiva against a colon widely in this item to indicate pauses, with a colon alone indicating a lesser pause. A dotted form of paragraphus is placed between the end of a chapter and the next chapter heading, and also at points within the text- particularly at significant moments in the narrative. Incipits/explicits are penned in a thicker duct. Notae are sometimes red? and sometimes in standard ink with a red C-shaped paraph.
Other: quire and leaf sigs are sometimes visible.
Illustration

Item 1 has spaces for miniatures, and on fols 7r and 26r he has added instructions relating to the proposed illustrations ('rex equitans' and 'Regina regalibus cum duabus astantibus') See J.J. Thompson, Robert Thornton, 59-63.
Fol. 52v (opposite the beginning of the Morte Arthure: the page is adorned with amateur sketches of knights and a Charger in ink. One of the knights carries a mace and bears a heraldic charge of 3 leopards' faces; another sword wielding figure has 3 crowns on his shield, and is thus perhaps intended to represent king Arthur, although the crowns are ducal coronets rather than royal crowns; the ink used is apparently a similar shade to the items on fols 50-52, raising the possibility that this is a later addition.
Number of Scribal Hands

1 main hand, although fols 50-2 have been filled by a later hand (see items 2 and 3).
Style of Hands

The hand of Robert Thornton, a workaday Anglicana script that sometimes varies in size and duct, but is usually consistent and always legible.
Estimated Date of Hands

c. 1430-1450.
Scribal Annotation

Privity only:

There are a number of marginal 'nota bene' sometimes with a simple C-shaped paraph mark, and sometimes in red ink- they all appear to be scribal, but it is possible that this is a layering of notae, applied at different times, as opposed to a marginal apparatus copied from an exemplar.
"It was likynge to ȝow, ffadire, for to sende me in to þis werlde, þat I sulde make asethe for mans trespas þat he did to vs: and as sone as þou said thus, I said ,I go', and as it es wretyne in þe spalme of me þat I sulde full-fill thy will, my gode, so wold I" (Horstmann, vol. 1, 219) fol. 180v.

"Rightewyse fadire, sen þou owtterly ordeyned þat I sall suffire ded one þe crosse for mans saule, thy will be done. Bot I recomand to ȝowe my dere modir, & my disciples" (200) fol. 180r.
"and ofte-tyme þey smote hyme with þe septure one þe heuede fore scorne & dispite; and beholde his blyssede face all rynnande with rede blode." (204) fol. 182r.

"And whene cho sawe hir childe þus chargede with þis hevy birdene, & he runne al ouere with blode, cho fell in swunynge and nerehand was dede for sorowe" (205) fol. 182v.

"Thane they nakynde hym agayne be-for all þe pepill and rafe of bustously his clothes þat were drye & bakene to his blessid body all-abowte hyme in his blyssede blode, and so they drew ofe þe flesche & þe skyne with-owttyne any pete" (205) fol. 182v.

"ffor oure lady hange one þe Rode with hire dere childe in soule, and rathere couett to dye with hym pene to lyfe" (206) 183r.

"He called hire not modir bot womane, þat cho sulde nott for tendirnes of lufe haue more sorowe ne dissese" (206) 183r.

"And þofe-all þese wordes be noghte pleynly contenede in þe gosepell, neuer-þe-lesse þe gosepell beris witnesse þat oure lorde Ihesu dyd many thynges þat þe Euangelisteȝ wrote noghte" (213) fol. 186r.

"Come, my lorde Ihesu. Come, þou onely my hope. Come to me, my dere childe. And whylles scho prayed thus with louely teres: sodeynly come oure lord Ihesu in clothes whyte as any snawe" (213) fol. 186v.

'Marie M' has been penned beside the opening to the chapter beginning, " MHow Maudeleyne & hir systers com to þe sepulcre" (214) fol. 186v; a nota bene occurs on the other side of the text in the right hand side of the text block.

"He stode homly among þeme, schewyng þe wondes of his handes & fete & side; þene he Opynde þeire gostely wittys þat þay myghte vndirstande holy writt & knowe þe prevetes of his passione & his resurreccione" (217) fol. 188v; it is possible that the title of the text in the Thornton MS may be derived from this moment in the text.
"Be-holde also oure lady þere, fore all þe disciples were gadirde to hire for socoure & comforthe" (218) fol. 188v.

Just before the closing section of the text, a passage is marked as being especially significant, with notae on either side of the text block and a marginal stanza/paragraph sign* used to indicate the beginning of the passage (the only time this type of mark occurs in the Privity): " I trow sothefastly þat if þou couthe pete & compassione of his passione, and had þi herte and þi mynd gedirde to-gedire & nott distracte abowte in þe werlde abowte oþer thynges & oþer fantassies, þat þou sulde fele in euerylkone of þes apperynges a newe feste gostely and a new pasche. And euery sononday suldes þou hafe so, If þou wolde one ffryday before with hole mynde & feruent deuocyone hafe sorowe and pete of Cristes passione" (218) fol. 189r.

Notable Dialect Features

LALME, I: 98.

The Privity is one of the texts that is not copied in Thornton's own Yorkshire dialect, but instead in a dialect with prominent SW Lincolnshire features. See also Angus McIntosh, 'The Textual Transmission of the Alliterative Morte Arthure', English and Medieval Studies Presented to J.R.R. Tolkein (London, 1962) 231-40, where the argument is made that the Privity and Morte Arthure where both derived from a single Lincolnshire exemplar.

A small '+' beside, "for þe fals Iewes lefte nott so mekill one hyme as his preue clothes: and þerfore his sorowefull modire wente in gret haste to hir sone & halses hyme and hilles hym with the vaile of hire heuede" (205) 182v; it is possible but uncertain whether this is scribal.
A barely discernable '+' in the gutter area, beside, "Than scho lifte vp hir eghne to þe heuene-warde & prayede to þe fadir, sayande: Endles ffadire, I recomende to ȝowe my dere sone Ihesu, & myne aghene soule, þe wilke I lefe here with hym" (212) fol. 185v.
