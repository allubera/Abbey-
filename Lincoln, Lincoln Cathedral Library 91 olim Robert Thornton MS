Some of the texts in this manuscript concern Arthur and romances (such as the Morte Arthur). A few deal with charms and another 
section concerns religoius and devotional texts. Some of the texts that were devotional in nature were widely shared between the manuscripts 
while the other texts circulated in manuscripts that did not contain the Abbey (whether they contained other devotional texts is 
unknown). The focus of prayer in this manuscript was to Jesus (rather than to Mary or the trinity).

**All Miracle of the Virgin texts will be treated as a single entry due to their similar nature**
